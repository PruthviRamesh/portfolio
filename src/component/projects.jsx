                <span>In this project, we leverage deep learning techniques to automatically classify X-ray
                    images into normal, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 classes.
                    Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture has been fine-tuned for the specific task of
                    pneumonia and COVID-19 detection.</span>
